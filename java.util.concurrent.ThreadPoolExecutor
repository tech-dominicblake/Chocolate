Please confirm that we should randomize which label is shown, or if each state uses a specific one.

-Progress & Stats

A tracker shows 13 chocolates: Green = Round 1, Purple = Round 2, Blue = Super Game. Confirm this is correct.

At game end, stats will show: Chocolates Consumed, Truths Answered, Dares Completed, Tasks Completed, Times Chickened Out, Super Game Played?, Avg Time per Round. Please confirm these are the correct data points.

-Encouragement Messages

After a successful Truth/Dare, an Encouragement Toast is shown.

After a Fail, a Failure Toast + Post-Fail message is shown.

At Level 1/2 completion or full completion, a Congratulations Toast is shown. Please confirm if these should be randomized each time.

-Edge Cases

What happens if both players bail at the same time?

In Game B, should the center chocolate be locked until the end?these should be randomized each time.

Should timers for dares be mandatory, or optional as the doc suggests?

If the phone is offline, should the app still allow play with locally cached prompts/dare lists, and sync later?
